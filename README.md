# Ludum Dare 42 Prep

This repo is for testing some things in Pygame before LD42 starts, and also 
to get a little boilerplate in place for whatever kind of game I decide to 
make for it.

### Version 1
Moving a ghost sprite around the screen  

### Version 2
Animated sprite moving on the screen  

### Version 3
Smooth movement, automatic animation from a sprite sheet, and re-usable code 
behind the scenes  

### Version 4
Walls and floor, simple collisions, simple "gravity"  

### Version 5
Better gravity and movement, kind of weird jumping
