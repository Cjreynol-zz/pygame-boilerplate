# Pygame Boilerplate code

This repository holds a number of classes to simplify the creation of games 
using the Pygame library.  

### Version 1
Moving a sprite around the screen  

### Version 2
Animated sprite moving on the screen  

### Version 3
Smooth movement, automatic animation from a sprite sheet

### Version 4
Walls and floor, simple collisions, simple "gravity"  

### Version 5
Better gravity and movement, kind of weird jumping  

### Version 6
Even better gravity and jumping, platforms, collectable items  

### Version 7
Multiple animations for the same sprite
